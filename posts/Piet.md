While mostly included to give my site some more content since it will unsurprisingly be a little
sparse for a while, I am irrationally proud of this particular program. I wrote it as a
response to the [FizzBuzz](http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2007/02/why-cant-programmers-program.html)
"proof-you-can-code" question on the entrance application for [Hacker School](http://hackerschool.com/).
It has some good memories wrapped up in it and it was written on a train
(which is pretty much the best place to be) so I show it off whenever I can.

So, without much ado, I present the prettiest program I have, and most likely ever will, write.

If you are done admiring this beautiful program, I highly recommend checking out the work of
Mondrian. He is my favorite abstractionist artist by far.
