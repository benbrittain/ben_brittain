  <p>
  I am Ben Brittain. I was born in 1993.
  Currently I am a student at Rochester Institute of Technology studying Computer Science with
  minors in Mathematics as well as Chinese. In the summer of 2012 I was in a fantastic
  <a href="http://www.hackerschool.com">Hacker School</a> batch. In the past I have worked at
  the National Cancer Institute, various student jobs, and interned at
  <a href="http://mozilla.org">Mozilla</a>. After this semester, I will be returning
  to Mozilla for another amazing summer.

  I am a strong advocate for Open/Libre software. I use GNU/linux, with <a
    href="http://archlinux.org/">Arch</a> as my distro of choice. I prefer the
  safer and more functional languages to those that aren't, despite the fact that I more often than
  not work on "low-level" projects. I am extremely excited about a variety of topics including
  crypto-currency, PLT, Mars, transhumanism & coffee. My political views skew toward a form of
  Market Anarchism/Voluntaryism with a bit of crypto-"ness" mixed in for good measure.
  This site serves the purpose of being a place where I can express my views
  in a concise and digestible manner as well as a place to show off various bits of CS hackery.
